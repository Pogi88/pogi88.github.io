            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This analysis explores the relationships between characters in the Harry Potter universe using network analysis.</p>
            <p>The Harry Potter real dataset has 254 nodes and 606 links. The network is undirected but it is weighted.</p>
            <p>The nodes here are all the characters that appear throughout the whole Harry Potter book series (all 7 books), and links are the relationships between them. The links are based on whether two characters appear in a window of five sentences in the text. The weight values are established based on how many times a certain pair appears in the before-mentioned context.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="network-properties">
            <h2>Network Properties</h2>
            <div id="diameter">
                <h3>Diameter</h3>
                <p>The diameter of the network is 9, which means the longest shortest path between any two characters is 9 links.</p>
                <p>The longest chain of character relationships connecting any two characters in the network would have 9 links.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="average-degree">
                <h3>Average Degree</h3>
                <p>The average degree of the network is around 5.12, indicating that each character has on average 5 connections. An average degree of 5.12 could contribute to the small-world property, particularly if coupled with a moderate clustering coefficient and a relatively short average path length.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="average-shortest-path">
                <h3>Average Shortest Path</h3>
                <p>The average shortest path of 3.53 in our Harry Potter social network suggests that characters are relatively closely connected, indicating a high level of interaction and communication within the network.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="average-clustering-coefficient">
                <h3>Average Clustering Coefficient</h3>
                <p>A value of 0.17 suggests that while there is some clustering in our Harry Potter social network, it may not be as tightly knit as some real-world social networks.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="assortativity-coefficient">
                <h3>Assortativity Coefficient</h3>
                <p>The assortativity coefficient quantifies the tendency of nodes in a network to connect to other nodes that are similar in some way. A negative assortativity coefficient suggests disassortative mixing, meaning nodes with different characteristics are more likely to connect to each other.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="distributions">
            <h2>Distribution Plots</h2>
            <h3>Degree Distribution</h3>
            <div class="visualization">
                <div id="vis"></div>
            </div>
            <p>The decreasing trend in the histogram indicates that as the degree value increases, the number of nodes with that degree decreases. This suggests that there are fewer nodes with higher degrees, which could indicate the presence of a few hubs or highly connected nodes.</p>
            <div class="visualization">
                <div id="vis2"></div>
            </div>
            <p>The x-axis represents the degrees (k) of nodes in the graph, and the y-axis represents the probability distribution P(k) (or the count of nodes with each degree normalized by the total number of nodes).</p>
            <p>The shape of the plot suggests a scale-free network, common in many real-world networks like social networks and the internet.</p>
            <div class="visualization">
                <div id="vis3"></div>
            </div>
            <p>We can visualize the same thing on a logarithmic scale as well.</p>
            <h3>Clustering Coefficient Distribution</h3>
            <div class="visualization">
                <div id="vis4"></div>
            </div>
            <p>The very tall first bar indicates that there is a large number of nodes in our network with a very low clustering coefficient, but there are a few nodes that tend to form clusters with other nodes.</p>
            <h3>Degree Centrality Distribution</h3>
            <p>Degree centrality is a measure of the importance of a node in a graph based on the number of edges (or connections) it has.</p>
            <div class="visualization">
                <div id="vis5"></div>
            </div>
            <p>The tall bar at the lower end of the x-axis indicates that there is a large number of nodes in the network with low degree centrality. These nodes are likely located on the periphery of the network and have fewer connections compared to central nodes.</p>
            <h3>Betweenness Centrality Distribution</h3>
            <p>Betweenness centrality is a measure of a node's importance based on the number of shortest paths that pass through it. Nodes with high betweenness centrality often act as bridges between different parts of the network.</p>
            <div class="visualization">
                <div id="vis6"></div>
            </div>
            <p>The tall bar at the lower end of the x-axis indicates that there is a large number of nodes in our network with low betweenness centrality.</p>
            <h3>Eigenvector Centrality Distribution</h3>
            <p>Eigenvector centrality measures the influence of a node in a network by considering both its direct connections and the importance of its neighbors.</p>
            <div class="visualization">
                <div id="vis7"></div>
            </div>
            <p>This histogram also shows a similar shape.</p>

            <h2>Centrality Measures: Identifying Important Nodes</h3>
            <h3>Degree Centrality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Degree centrality measures the number of edges connected to a node.</li>
                <li>Nodes with higher degree centrality are more connected within the network, indicating a higher level of influence or importance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Betweenness Centrality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes in the network.</li>
                <li>Nodes with high betweenness centrality act as bridges or mediators in the network.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Closeness Centrality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Closeness centrality measures the average distance of a node to all other nodes in the network.</li>
                <li>Nodes with high closeness centrality are close to many other nodes in the network.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Eigenvector Centrality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Eigenvector centrality measures the importance of a node in the network by considering the centrality of its neighbors.</li>
                <li>Nodes with high eigenvector centrality are connected to other nodes that are themselves central.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>PageRank Centrality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>PageRank evaluates the importance of a node in a network by considering both the quantity and quality of its incoming links.</li>
                <li>Nodes with high PageRank are connected to other important nodes, making them pivotal in information dissemination.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Harmonic Centrality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Harmonic centrality measures the centrality of a node in a network by considering the sum of the reciprocals of the shortest path distances from that node to all other nodes.</li>
                <li>Nodes with high harmonic centrality are positioned to efficiently communicate with other nodes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Load Centrality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Load centrality evaluates the centrality of a node in a network based on the amount of traffic or load that passes through it.</li>
                <li>Nodes with high load centrality serve as critical junctions for information or resource flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, we can visualize the comparison between these centralities in every combination:</p>
            <div id="vis8-container">
                <div id="vis8"></div>
            </div>
            <p>Here we can look for correlations between the respective measures.</p>
            <h3>Identifying the top 10 nodes for each metric</h3>
            <p>We need to create a new dataframe to store these important nodes based on the centralities.</p>
            <div class="visualization">
                <div id="vis9"></div>
            </div>
            <p>When it comes to the top 10 nodes in our Harry Potter network, almost all centrality measures agree on the Harry Potter node to be the most influential node, which is not surprising, considering he is the main character of the books.</p>
            <p>Dobby and Percy Weasley could be considered the second most influential nodes since they take the first or second place mostly at every centrality measure.</p>
            <p>It is surprising that Hermione and Ron do not really appear as influential nodes.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>What is the project about?</h3>
            <p>The project involves analyzing the relationships between characters in the Harry Potter universe using network analysis. The aim is to explore the structure and dynamics of the character relationships within the network.</p>

            <h3>What data are we using?</h3>
            <p>The data used for the analysis includes characters from the Harry Potter book series and their relationships. The dataset consists of 254 nodes (characters) and 606 links (relationships). The relationships are determined based on the co-occurrence of characters within a window of five sentences in the text.</p>

            <h3>Why are the data interesting?</h3>
            <p>The data are interesting because they provide insights into the relational network of the Harry Potter universe. The analysis helps uncover which characters are most influential, how they are connected, and what structures (such as small-world networks and clusters) are present in the network.</p>

            <h3>Who is the target user?</h3>
            <p>The target users include researchers interested in network analysis, Harry Potter fans, and professionals working in data analysis and visualization.</p>

            <h3>What do we want the user to learn from this?</h3>
            <p>Users can learn about the basic concepts and methods of network analysis, as well as the complexity of relationships between characters in the Harry Potter universe. They will also gain insights into how network properties and centrality measures can be applied to a real dataset.</p>

            <h3>How scalable is the solution?</h3>
            <p>The solution is highly scalable as the methods of network analysis can be applied to larger and more complex networks. The tools and techniques used in this analysis can be adapted to other datasets that have similar types of relational structures.</p>

            <h3>How automatable is the solution?</h3>
            <p>The solution is highly automatable since the processes of network analysis and visualization can be performed programmatically. Data processing, calculation of network metrics, and creation of graphs can all be automated.</p>

            <h3>What would be useful to add?</h3>
            <p>It would be useful to expand the solution with additional data analysis methods or deeper investigation of character interactions. Integrating text mining and natural language processing could also enrich the data further.</p>
